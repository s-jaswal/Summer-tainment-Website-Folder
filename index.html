            <span class="first-character sc">W</span>e finally made it out of
            the groupchat! We started at 8 AM on a Saturday morning. I was
            mentally and physically ready to walk around the entire the city. We
            took a ferry, went to Staten Island, took millions of train rides,
            ate Thai food, went to the Vanderbilt museum, went to the Edge, and
            alot more.

            It was extremely hot but it was nice to walk over 10 miles while
            observing NYC. The metro station trains were extremely crowded and
            getting around places was exhausting and exhilaring at the same
            time. I think we were running around so much that we forgot to eat
            lunch.
