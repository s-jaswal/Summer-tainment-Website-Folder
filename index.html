            <span class="first-character sc">W</span>e finally made it out of
            the groupchat! We started at 8 AM on a Saturday morning. I was
            mentally and physically ready to walk around the entire the city. We
            took a ferry, went to Staten Island, took millions of train rides,
            ate Thai food, went to the Vanderbilt museum, went to the Edge, and
            alot more.

            <ul>

              <li>In the morning we took a Ferry to Staten Island - The Staten Island Ferry is a popular 
                transportation option in NYC. It provides scenic views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and the Manhattan 
                skyline.
              </li>
              
              <li>We visited a bunch of museums like the Vanderilt Museum: It is the house of extensive collections of art, marine 
                specimens, and cultural artifacts from around the world. It offers visitors a glimpse into the life and interests of
                the Vanderbilt family. 
              </li>
              
              <li>In the night, we visited the Edge: The Edge is a prominent attraction in NYC, an observation deck located 
                in Hudson Yards. One one of the most distinctive features is a triangular glass floor that extxends 80 feet 
                out from the building, allowing visitors to look directly down to the street below.

            <span class="first-character atw">I</span>t was extremely hot but it
            was nice to walk over 10 miles while observing NYC. The metro
            station trains were extremely crowded and getting around places was
            exhausting and exhilaring at the same time. I think we were running
            around so much that we forgot to eat lunch.
          </p>

          <p class="margin-top-10">We did many interactive activities. There was so much to explore. I think 
            you need multiple days to really get a grasp of the visuals of NYC. One really great part of going from morning to 
            night is that you get to observe how NYC looks at early morning, noon, afternoon, sunset, night, and midnight. 
            Every part of the day has its own beauty.
